# Expansion Exercise

## Part 1 - Making Some Files

1. Create the following 60 files **using a single command** with the powers of expansion!
    
    ```bash
    
    morning-day-1
    morning-day-2
    ...
    morning-day-30
    
    afternoon-day-1
    afternoon-day-2
    ... 
    afternoon-day-30
    ```
    
2. For this next bit, you'll need to use the following command: `date +"%m-%d-%y"` This command will print out the current date using the format *month-day-year*, like **09-19-21**. Use this command to create a new file with the name ***todos-DATE.txt***, where DATE is the output of the above date command.  For example, if we ran the command on September 19th 2021, the resulting file would be named `todos-09-19-21.txt`.  

## Part 2

Using the files that we created in the previous section...

- List out all the files that end with the number `9`
- List out all the filenames where the second to last character is `1`
- List out all the files that start with afternoon and then end with the number `7`
- Make a new folder called `Mornings`, and move all the files that start with `morning` inside of it.

## Part 3

- Using a SINGLE command (with expansion), create the following folder structure.  You will need to use the `-p` option with mkdir!

```bash
Year/
	Winter/
		Yard/
		House/
	Spring/
		Yard/
		House/
	Summer/
		Yard/
		House/
	Fall/
		Yard/
		House/
```

- Finally, in each of the `Yard/` and `House/` Directories create a `todos.txt` file and a `done.txt` file.  Do this with a single line, without changing directories!  Use expansion! The resulting folder/file structure should look like this:
Year/
	Winter/
		Yard/
			todos.txt
			done.txt
		House/
			todos.txt
			done.txt
	Spring/
		Yard/
			todos.txt
			done.txt
		House/
			todos.txt
			done.txt
	Summer/
		Yard/
			todos.txt
			done.txt
		House/
			todos.txt
			done.txt
	Fall/
		Yard/
			todos.txt
			done.txt
		House/
			todos.txt
			done.txt
